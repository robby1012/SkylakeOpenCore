# A bit History
It's been a long time since I installed Hackintosh
Last time I used iAtkos distro on my Asus Laptop to install Snow Leopard, 
just knew OpenCore Recently, god, the documentation is really awesome.
and since I'm a programmer so all the setting and coding looks familiar, LOL.
So I decided to give it a try

USB Controller is the most hurdle for installing hackintosh to this system

You **NEED** to mapping your motherboard USB using [USBToolBox](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool)
SSDT also **very important**, don't use precompiled from internet
BUILD your own using [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)
Minimum SMBIOS to use : iMac18,1 but this config I used iMac19,1
You can generate your own using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)

Copy generated UTBMap.kext to EFI\OC\Kexts

**Don't Messing NVRAM Setting except boot-args**

You can edit config.plist from OpenShell without booting to windows
but you must test wich partition of your installer
OpenShell will list available partition first time you open it

type, example :
`` FS0: ``

`` ls ``

if you not see EFI folder, try another partion i.e FS1:

if you see EFI folder, type this command:

`` cd EFI\OC\ ``

`` edit config.plist ``

make your necessary edit
Press Ctrl+S to save

type command ``reset`` to reboot PC


## Step
## BIOS Configuration
### Disabled
* Serial Port
* Parallel Port
* Secure Boot

### Enabled
* Virtualization VT-D

Copy EFI Folder to EFI partition of Installer
on Windows you can use Aomei Partition Assistant. Assign EFI partition Drive Letter.
Use Explorer++ (run as admin) to navigate (Default Windows Explorer Won't Allow you to access)

Set Motherboard Boot Order to your Instalation Device
